measureR is an an R Shiny application for educational and psychological measurement, including:

- **Content Validity (CV)**
- **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)**
- **Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)**
- **Classical Test Theory (CTT)**
- **Item Response Theory (IRT)**

All analyses can be performed **without writing any code**, making the package accessible for researchers, students, and applied analysts.

---

## Installation

```r
# Install from CRAN (when available)
install.packages("measureR")

# Install development version from GitHub (optional)
remotes::install_github("hdmeasure/measureR")
```

---

## Launch the Application

```r
library(measureR)
measureR::run_measureR()
```

This opens the full Shiny application, including all LSA modules, data upload, built-in datasets, interactive plots, and reporting features.

---

## Features

### ✔ Content Validity (CV)
- Aiken’s V, CVR (Lawshe), I-CVI, and S-CVI/Ave computation.
- Automatic critical value comparison and interpretation badges.
- Clear tabular summaries and export-ready results.

### ✔ Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
- KMO, Bartlett test, parallel analysis.
- Factor extraction with rotation.
- Factor scores and loading matrix export.
- Clean HTML summaries for clearer interpretation.

### ✔ Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
- Lavaan model editor.
- Fit measures, loadings, factor scores.
- Fully customized SEM path diagrams.

### ✔ Classical Test Theory (CTT)
- Item difficulty and discrimination indices.
- Test reliability (α), SEM, and score distribution analysis.
- Distractor analysis for multiple-choice items.
- Comprehensive item and test-level summary outputs.

### ✔ Item Response Theory (IRT)
- Supports dichotomous and polytomous items.
- Automatically fits Rasch, 2PL, 3PL (or PCM/GRM/GPCM).
- ICC plots, test information, factor scores.
- Multi-dimensional visualization with 3D surfaces and heatmaps.

## Live Demo (Shiny Application)

The full functionality of **measureR** is available through an interactive
Shiny web application.

👉 **Launch the live application:**  
https://measure.shinyapps.io/measureR/

The web interface provides direct access to all analysis modules, including
Content Validity, Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Classical Test
Theory, and Item Response Theory, allowing users to explore the application
without local installation.
